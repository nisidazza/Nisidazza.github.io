        <h1>IQ & EQ</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h5>
        <p>Daniel Goleman, psychologist, lecturer, and science journalist and also author of Emotional Intelligence,
            defines Emotional Intelligence (EQ) as <q><em>the ability to identify, assess, and control one’s own
                    emotions,
                    the emotions of others, and that of groups</q></em>.<br> In other words is the ability to recognize
            and
            understand emotions in yourself and others, and use this awareness to manage your behavior
            and relationships.</p>
        <p>There are four fundamental aspects of EQ:</p>
        <img src="core-images/EQ-Framework.jpg" alt="EQ Framework" id="img-framework">
        <ul>
            <span>
                <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> : it's about recognizing your emotions. When people with a <em>Low
                        EQ</em> get angry or sad they will not look at why they are feeling in that way : usually they
                    blame others, or become depressed or bullies. Oppositely, people with <em>High EQ</em> try to
                    understand why their are feeling that way, what’s causing it and they will try to get better.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Self-management</strong> : it’s about how you manage yourself. People with a <em>Low EQ</em>
                    that become angry or sad, will shout at other people or start a fight, or they redirect their
                    emotions in a
                    self-destructive way.
                    People with <em>High EQ</em> instead, will try to manage their emotions, take actions. For example
                    they would deal with a stressed situation
                    by working-out or meeting people that can cheer them up.
                    up
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Social-awareness</strong> : this skill is about treating people according to their emotional
                    reactions. A person with a <em>Low EQ</em> is not able to see social cues and micro behaviors of
                    others, it usually goes wherever the wind takes
                    him/her and sometimes other people can take advantage of that.
                    On the contrary, a person with an <em>High EQ</em> listens to others and put words in context, ask
                    questions about the other people, read between the
                    lines.
                </li>
            </span>
            <br>
            <li> <strong>Social-management</strong> : it's about managing relationships, finding common ground and
                feeling a rapport with others. A person with a <em>Low EQ</em> has problems finding friends or
                like-minded
                people, or getting its point during a conversation. It often feels misunderstood and it
                will blame it on superficial things (for example not enough money).
                A person with a <em>High EQ</em> uses its intuitions and adapts if necessary, find a win-win
                situation, common ground in order to connect with another person.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How is it different to IQ?</h5>
        <img src="core-images/eqvsiq.jpg" alt="IQ vs EQ" id="img-iqvseq">
        <br>
        <p>IQ (or Intelligence Quotient):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>is a number/score derived from a standardized intelligence test;</li>
            <li>is used to determine academic abilities and identify individuals with intelligence above the average;
            </li>
            <li>is an inborn ability;</li>
            <li>ensures success in School.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>EQ</p>
        <ul>
            <li>is a learned and improved ability;</li>
            <li>in the workplace, is it used to identify leaders and good team players;</li>
            <li>ensures success in life.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Why is it important?</h5>
        <p>EQ is important because it helps you to develop significant human relationships: it determines how you
            interact and connect with others, and how do you treat people in your life.
            <br>It also assists you in looking after your physical and mental health and wellbeing: how do you cope in a
            situation of anger or pressure or how do you face the crisis.<br>
            Micheal Benner, seminar leader, speaker, coach & author of Fearless Intelligence, during his talk at TEDx
            2011
            started his presentation with this question:<br>
            <em>"If success doesn’t create happiness and love – what
                does?"</em>
            <br>
            He states that each individual is responsible for love and happiness in his own life, achievable through
            self-empowerment and emotional intelligence. He emphasizes the importance of always taking responsibility
            for our emotions, regardless of the way they’re effected by other people, and being empatich and caring
            about others.

                happiness and love is the way to success."</h3>
