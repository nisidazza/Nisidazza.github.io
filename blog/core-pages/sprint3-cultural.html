        <h1>IQ & EQ</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>What is Emotional Intelligence</h5>
        <p>Daniel Goleman, psychologist, lecturer, and science journalist and also author of Emotional Intelligence,
            defines Emotional Intelligence (EQ) as <q><em>the ability to identify, assess, and control one’s own
                    emotions,
                    the emotions of others, and that of groups</q></em>.<br> In other words is the ability to recognize
            and
            understand emotions in yourself and others, and use this awareness to manage your behavior
            and relationships.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="eq-framework">
            <p>There are four fundamental aspects of EQ:</p>
            <img src="core-images/EQ-Framework.jpg" alt="EQ Framework">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> : it's about recognizing your emotions. When people with a <em>Low
                        EQ</em> get angry or sad they will not look at why they are feeling in that way : usually they
                    blame others, or become depressed or bullies. Oppositely, people with <em>High EQ</em> try to
                    understand why their are feeling that way, what’s causing it and they will try to get better.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Self-management</strong> : it’s about how you manage yourself. People with a <em>Low EQ</em>
                    that become angry or sad, will shout at other people or start a fight, or they redirect their
                    emotions in a
                    self-destructive way.
                    People with <em>High EQ</em> instead, will try to manage their emotions, take actions. For example
                    they would deal with a stressed situation
                    by working-out or meeting people that can cheer them up.
                    up
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Social-awareness</strong> : this skill is about treating people according to their emotional
                    reactions. A person with a <em>Low EQ</em> is not able to see social cues and micro behaviors of
                    others, it usually goes wherever the wind takes
                    him/her and sometimes other people can take advantage of that.
                    On the contrary, a person with an <em>High Eq</em> listens to others and put words in context, ask
                    questions about the other people, read between the
                    lines.
                </li><br>
                <li> <strong>Social-management</strong> : it's about managing relationships, finding common ground and
                    feeling a rapport with others. A person with a <em>Low EQ</em> has problems finding friends or
                    like-minded
                    people, or getting its point during a conversation. It often feels misunderstood and it
                    will blame it on superficial things (for example not enough money).
                    A person with a <em>High-Eq</em> uses its intuitions and adapts if necessary, find a win-win
                    situation, common ground in order to connect with another person.
