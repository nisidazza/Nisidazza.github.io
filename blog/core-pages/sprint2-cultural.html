    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <div class="foundations">
      <h3>Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
      <h5>My long term goal and/or career pathway</h5>
      <p>I aim to become a front-end developer and specialize in Web Design.
        I think DevAcademy is a good start-point. After graduation, I hope to find a job in my field of
        interest and continue to develop my skills and increase my knowledge.</p>
      <h5>Non-technical - human skills I would you like to see developed in myself while at EDA</h5>
      <p>I am an introvert by nature, so I like spending time on my own - for example, during my lunch break
        at work, I have always looked for an empty table. EDA could be a good opportunity to improve my
        social skills.
        Another aspect of my personality I would like to work on, is my fear of public speaking that I
        probably have since I was born. By doing projects’ presentation I hope to overcome this state of
        anxiety that overwhelms me every time.
      </p>
      <h5>Description of your own strengths and limitations</h5>
      <p>My key-strengths are:<br>
        <u>Supportiveness</u> : despite my introvert nature, I more than happy to help coworkers getting
        projects finished on time or listen to friends’ concerns and find ways to resolve them. I take
        pleasure in finding satisfying resolutions to day-to-day challenges.<br>
        <u>Determination & Consistency</u> : I always do my best to complete a task or reach my goals,
        especially when I think they are right and all the efforts are worthwhile.<br>
        <u>Transparency & Accountability</u> : I am not able to hide my emotions or my doubts even if I
        wanted
        to, they would be written all over my face. This helps me to begin a genuine relationships and
        let others see me for who I really am, they can trust me and this increases accountability.
        <br>
        My weaknesses are:<br>
        <u>Introversion</u> : even if I enjoy my own company, I can see the limitations that this aspect
        of my
        character can bring. Sometimes I find it difficult to be around others and it takes time for me
        to build a relationship with my colleagues or the thought of speaking at a meeting send me into
        a cold sweat.<br>
        <u>Asking for help as a last resort</u> : usually I try to solve a problem by myself, from one
        hand
        because I am a bit proud and I don’t want to be judged , and from the other hand because I see a
        challenge as a way to put myself to the test.<br>
        <u>Taking criticism personally</u>: I don’t consider myself a touchy person and the reason why
        sometimes I don’t like criticism is because I see them like a failure and I get angry at myself.
        The only judgement I don’t accept is the non-constructive one, which often leads to hurt
        feelings and demotivation.
      </p>
      <h5> How I will manage my workload in this programme & how I will manage myself to work productively and
        safely with other people</h5>
      <p>I will use a time management tool, like Toggl or Pomodoro, to monitor and set the maximum time I can
        spend
        looking for a solution. If I am not able to solve a problem within that time frame I will ask
        someone for help and I will share my knowledge in order to find a quick solution together: two
        heads are better than one!<br>
        I will try to engage myself in social activities offered by EDA, like for example yoga classes,
        and
        spend time with my peers (taking a cup of coffee together during a break or having lunch
        together) to know each other better.<br>
        I will accept and respect opinions or criticism from other learners, facilitators and community
        representatives, by keeping in mind that they are here to help me not judge me.
      </p>
      <h5>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h5>
      <p>As mentioned before, I would try to solve the problem by myself, breaking it down into smaller pieces
        and then probably by looking for some help online, doing some research on Google.
        If I could not find a solution in a reasonable amount of time, I would ask for help from my
        facilitator or colearners, depending on the type of problem I am working on.
      </p>
      <h5>What I expect from the facilitation team</h5>
      <p>I expect to receive help and guidance when requested during both the foundation and bootcamp.
        I would like to receive constructive feedback about my work and engagement.
      </p>
      <h5>Scheduling information </h5>
      <p>When I left my job to start my journey as a software developer, I decided to invest my time and
        attention completely to Enspiral DevAcademy. I'm still trying to cut out some time for my
        hobbies and for myself though, as I think well-being is an important element for a balanced
        life.

      <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
      <h5>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h5>
      <p>After leaving EDA I hope to find a job as a Front End developer or a similar position that at the same time
        allows me to deepen my knowledge in Web Design.
      </p>

      <h5>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h5>
      <p>
        After reviewing what was written in sprint 2, I can see that my strengths and limitations have not changed
        during Foundations also because most of them are social-skill related. I am sure that being aware of this will
        help me to better deal with my relationship with others during BootCamp.
      </p>

      <h5>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be? </h5>
      <p>Speaking di front of others has been one of my biggest fears since I was a child, so trying to overcome this
        obstacle will not be easy.
      </p>

      <h5>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA? </h5>
      <p>I would like to develop my ability to communicate with others, engaging myself more in social interactions,
        pairing with others without feeling judged and under pressure.
      </p>

      <h5>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h5>
      <p>I expect to be followed during my learning process, I hope to receive understanding and availability from all
        teachers and tutors, they should be ready to help me when I don't understand something or I am struggling with
        a
        project.
      </p>

      <h5>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h5>
      <p>I will strive to work as hard as I usually do when I have a goal to achieve but trying to maintain a certain
        balance between study and leisure. I will commit to working within groups even though I will still need some
        self-study time to fix the new topics in my head; to meet deadlines and be always present throughout the
        course.
