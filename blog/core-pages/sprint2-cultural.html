                <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
                <br>
                <h5>My long term goal and/or career pathway</h5>
                <p>I aim to become a front-end developer and specialize in Web Design.
                        I think DevAcademy is a good start-point. After graduation, I hope to find a job in my field of
                        interest and continue to develop my skills and increase my knowledge.</p>
                <h5>Non-technical - human skills I would you like to see developed in myself while at EDA</h5>
                <p>I am an introvert by nature, so I like spending time on my own - for example, during my lunch break
                        at work, I have always looked for an empty table. EDA could be a good opportunity to improve my
                        social skills.
                        Another aspect of my personality I would like to work on, is my fear of public speaking that I
                        probably have since I was born. By doing projects’ presentation I hope to overcome this state of
                        anxiety that overwhelms me every time.
                </p>
                <h5>Description of your own strengths and limitations</h5>
                <p>My key-strengths are:<br>
                        <u>Supportiveness</u> : despite my introvert nature, I more than happy to help coworkers getting
                        projects finished on time or listen to friends’ concerns and find ways to resolve them. I take
                        pleasure in finding satisfying resolutions to day-to-day challenges.<br>
                        <u>Determination & Consistency</u> : I always do my best to complete a task or reach my goals,
                        especially when I think they are right and all the efforts are worthwhile.<br>
                        <u>Transparency & Accountability</u> : I am not able to hide my emotions or my doubts even if I
                        wanted
                        to, they would be written all over my face. This helps me to begin a genuine relationships and
                        let others see me for who I really am, they can trust me and this increases accountability.
                        <br>
                        My weaknesses are:<br>
                        <u>Introversion</u> : even if I enjoy my own company, I can see the limitations that this aspect
                        of my
                        character can bring. Sometimes I find it difficult to be around others and it takes time for me
                        to build a relationship with my colleagues or the thought of speaking at a meeting send me into
                        a cold sweat.<br>
                        <u>Asking for help as a last resort</u> : usually I try to solve a problem by myself, from one
                        hand
                        because I am a bit proud and I don’t want to be judged , and from the other hand because I see a
                        challenge as a way to put myself to the test.<br>
                        <u>Taking criticism personally</u>: I don’t consider myself a touchy person and the reason why
                        sometimes I don’t like criticism is because I see them like a failure and I get angry at myself.
                        The only judgement I don’t accept is the non-constructive one, which often leads to hurt
                        feelings and demotivation.
                </p>
                <h5> How I will manage my workload in this programme & how I will manage myself to work productively and
                        safely with other people</h5>
                <p>I will use a time management tool, like Toggl or Pomodoro, to monitor and set the maximum time I can
                        spend
                        looking for a solution. If I am not able to solve a problem within that time frame I will ask
                        someone for help and I will share my knowledge in order to find a quick solution together: two
                        heads are better than one!<br>
                        I will try to engage myself in social activities offered by EDA, like for example yoga classes,
                        and
                        spend time with my peers (taking a cup of coffee together during a break or having lunch
                        together) to know each other better.<br>
                        I will accept and respect opinions or criticism from other learners, facilitators and community
                        representatives, by keeping in mind that they are here to help me not judge me.
                </p>
                <h5>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h5>
                <p>As mentioned before, I would try to solve the problem by myself, breaking it down into smaller pieces
                        and then probably by looking for some help online, doing some research on Google.
                        If I could not find a solution in a reasonable amount of time, I would ask for help from my
                        facilitator or colearners, depending on the type of problem I am working on.
                </p>
                <h5>What I expect from the facilitation team</h5>
                <p> expect to receive help and guidance when requested during both the foundation and bootcamp.
                        I would like to receive constructive feedback about my work and engagement.
                </p>
                <h5>Scheduling information </h5>
                <p>When I left my job to start my journey as a software developer, I decided to invest my time and
                        attention completely to Enspiral DevAcademy. I'm still trying to cut out some time for my
                        hobbies and for myself though, as I think well-being is an important element for a balanced life.
