            <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout
                life.<br>
                It is quite complex and includes several events occurring at molecular, synaptic and muscle
                levels over short and long periods of time. But understanding how the brain works can benefit people in
                different ways.</p>
            <img src="core-images/neuron-structure.png" alt="Neuron Structure" class="neuron">
            <p>A neuron consists of a cell body (soma), a tail (axon) and branching (dendrites). When we learn, these
                dendrites grow and connect with other neurons forming new pathways in the brain.<br>
                During infancy, the key to developing new connections is the <strong>surrounding environment</strong>,
                which
                relies on
                sensory (visual, auditory, tactile, smell) and motor stimuli.
                When we get older, we continue to have the ability to learn new activities, skills or languages.
                But being able to retain those abilities depends on our <strong>behavior</strong>: nothing is more
                effective
                than practice in
                learning and, according to Lara Boyd’s neuroscience, the bottom line is that <strong>we have to do the
                    work</strong>.<br>
                <strong>There is no recipe for learning</strong>: some people require more practice, other less; there
                is no
                a universal
                principle that works for all people at all ages. Each brain is unique so we need to personalize our
                learning.</p>
            <p><em>“Study how and what you learn best. Repeat those behaviors that are healthy for your brain, and break
                    those that are not. Practice. Learning is about doing the work that your brain requires.
                    You and your plastic brain are constantly being shaped by the world around you. Everything you do,
                    everything you encounter and everything you experience is changing your brain. And that can be for
                    the
                    better, but it can also be for the worse. Go out and build the brain you want”. - Lara Boyd
                </em></p>
            <p>In the past scientists used to believe that the brain was hard-wired, in other words static, unchanging
                and
                locked.
                Nowadays we know that this is not true: without neuroplasticity, any brain, not just the human brain,
                would
                be unable to develop from infancy through to adulthood.
            </p>
            <h5>Benefits of Neuroplasticity:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>It allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to <strong>compensate for injury and
                        disease</strong>
                    and to adjust
                    their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.<br>For example,
                    when
                    one
                    part of the brain is damaged, such as the area of the left hemisphere that controls speech, the
                    right
                    hemisphere of the brain may "pick up" some of the language abilities that were lost (Sanderson,
                    1991).
                </li>
                <li>It <strong>slows down the aging process</strong>: as we age, the rate of change in the brain
                    declines
                    but it does not
                    stop. Our brain can be maintained by a life of continual learning – older people have to keep
                    challenging their brain in order to create new neural pathways.</li>
                <li>It can <strong>restore old, lost connections and functions</strong> that have not been used in some
                    time.</li>
                <li>It can help to <strong>guide training programmes</strong> in sports activities which focus on the
                    importance of teaching and refining good
                    movements. In fact, to proficiently perform athletic movements the brain must coordinate with the
                    necessary muscle groups to produce the action. If a bad movement pattern is performed repeatedly,
                    the
                    technique will require more practice and time to fix/refine.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Practicing and Improving Neuroplasticity in my life</h5>
            <p>I will definitely keep learning new things, as this is also one of the reasons why I am attending EDA,
                and I
                believe that setting new goals is the best way to achieve that, in order to keep my enthusiasm and my
                motivation alive.<br>
                Another thing I will do is trying to increase the difficulty of a task or exercise in order to get out
                of my
                comfort zone, because only in this way the brain turns on and changes its pathways.
            </p>
            <p>I'll take a cue from one of Dr. Don Elger's classes where he teaches "how to learn" based on how the
                brain
                works.<br> I will increase my neuroplasticity in three ways:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Repetition</strong> : repeating a pattern over and over until it gets easy, because that
                        means that a
                        neural connections have been formed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice correct fundamentals</strong> : whatever I practice becomes permanent, so I
                        need to
                        apply the
                        learned concepts correctly every time in order to build correct knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learning in Authentic Environments</strong> : for example, while I am learning
                        javascript, I
                        could practice by applying the concepts into my blog.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
            <p>One central concept from the book “Mindset: The New Psychology of Success” – by Carol Dweck - is that
                <strong>the
                    view of yourself can determine the way you lead your life</strong>.</p>
            <p>C. Dweck contrasts two mindsets:<br>
                <img src="core-images/growthvsfixedmindset.jpg" alt="Difference between Fixed and Growth Mindset"
                    class="mindset-img">
                Fixed Mindset<br>
                <em>“Believing that your qualities are carved in stone — the fixed mindset — creates an urgency to prove
                    yourself over and over. If you only have a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality,
                    and a certain moral character — well, then you’d better prove that you have a healthy dose of them.
                    It simply wouldn’t do to look deficient in these most basic characteristics.”</em><br>
                Growth Mindset<br>
                <em>“In this mindset, the hand you’re dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth
                    mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your
                    efforts. Although people may differ in every which way — in their initial talents and aptitudes,
                    interests, or temperaments — everyone can change and grow through application and
                    exercise.”</em><br>
            </p>
            <p>In simple words, Growth Mindset is the <strong>power of believing that you can improve</strong> or, as
                Carol Dweck has
                defined it, <strong>the power of “yet”</strong>.<br>
                It’s relevant because:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>It helps you focusing on what are you doing , and enjoying what you are learning despite the
                        outcome;</li>
                    <li>Improve Your Self-Insight and Self-Esteem;</li>
                    <li>You don’t feel stupid, stressed or depressed when making errors: mistakes are not a failure,
                        instead you can learn from them.As well, a setback is useful because provides a feedback and you
                        can understand why something went wrong;</li>
                    <li>Strengthen Your Confidence;</li>
                    <li>It helps you to take responsibility for your actions and decisions because you don’t blame
                        others for them.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h5>Exploring Growth Mindset: how integrate it into my learning journey</h5>
            <p>While I was reading some articles on this topic, I found some examples of how a response to everyday
                situations can turn out to be of the kind of growth mindset rather than fixed.<br>
                One of the examples was running late and missing the bus or car pool.<br>
                A <u>fixed mindset</u> response will be to grumble, curse and call yourself or someone else names and
                then,
                remain in a foul mood for the rest of the day.<br>
                A <u>growth mindset</u> response will be to decide to go to bed earlier, set an alarm and lay out the
                clothes
                in the evening itself, so that tomorrow can be better and different.<br>
                So I found myself thinking of some situations that happened in my everyday life and how I
                reacted/behaved in a particular circumstance to see which kind of mindset I have.<br>
                I've noticed that every time I had to deal with something new, whether it's solving a javascript
                problem or trying a harder route with top roping, my first thought is "I can't do it, it's too
                difficult",
                although I find new challenges very stimulating. Unfortunately, in this case I have more a fixed
                mindset.<br>
                Understanding this made me realize that I need to change approach, so I will try to integrate Growth
                Mindset in my learning journey and in my life in general.<br>
                I will try to believe more in myself, in my own skills and abilities, simply by thinking “Yes, I can do
                it”, instead of “it’s too difficult for me”.<br>
                I will value the learning process over the end result, by prioritizing quality more than quantity.<br>
                I will try to not be unmotivated by a failure but see it as a lesson, an opportunity to learn and
                improve.
