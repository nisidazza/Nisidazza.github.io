            <li>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
                <p>I don’t think I learnt new things about myself, instead the core learning just confirmed them: I am
                    proud, every time I don't understand or I can't do something, it's a defeat for me; I found myself
                    working really hard as usual, but during this foundation more than ever. Maybe a new thing I learned
                    about myself is that I'm much more determined than I expected.</p>
            </li>
            <hr>
            <li>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                <p>I found really surprising how your personal behavior toward a problem/challenge has a big influence
                    on the final result, how this can determine if you have a growth mindset or a fixed one. Usually
                    when I find myself facing a difficult problem I always start with "I'll never make it", but thanks
                    to the research on growth mindset and neuroplasticity I changed my attitude towards the problem by
                    repeating to myself "I can do it".
                </p>
            </li>
            <hr>
            <li>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
                <p>Doing the research about each argument of every Sprint and think about how you could have “applied”
                    what you learned to yourself.
                </p>
            </li>
            <hr>
            <li>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development bootcamp course?
                <p>Since during a bootcamp you work with other people, I think that is really important for yourself to
                    understand who you are, what your skills are, your attitude towards a problem, how you interact with
                    other people, how you handle your relationship with others.
                </p>
            </li>
            <hr>
            <li>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
                <p>I do not consider the Core part a waste of time, I learned a lot of useful things, but the research
                    and reflection parts took time in each Sprint, time that I personally would have preferred to use in
                    studying and practicing programming. Perhaps a week, for both the core and the technical sections of
                    each sprint, is not enough.
