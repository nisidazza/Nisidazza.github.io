            <h1>Personal Core Values</h1>
            <br>
            <h5><em>"Core values are the fundamental beliefs of a person or organization. These guiding principles dictate
                behavior and can help people understand the difference between right and wrong."</em></h5>
            <br>
            <p>Based on the above definition I can assert that my personal core values are Honesty, Kindness
                and Respect.<br>
                I am an honest person―the truth always matters to me more than anything else.
                If I value this quality so much is because when I was in Middle School I was the one who did not
                behave correctly: “Let him who is without sin cast the first stone”, right?
                Here’s what happened: I cheated during a Music test. I hadn't studied as well as I should have
                so I
                kept my book opened with all my notes under my desk and I shamelessly copied all the answers.
                Well,
                obviously I got caught by my teacher. I was not so smart as I thought, after all. He took both
                my
                test and my book without any admonition, I felt so ashamed of myself.
                And so what? You would say.
                The following day ,during an after school activity - choir practice - my Music teacher had the
                brilliant idea to return the book to me and tell everybody what I did. It was so humiliating and
                for
                a person like me, shy and insecure, it was a pretty bad beating.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5><em>“Your values create your internal compass that can navigate how you make decisions in your life. If you
                compromise your core values, you go nowhere.” ― Roy T. Bennett
            </em></h5>
            <br>
            <p>Maybe this could seem a ridiculous example but I learnt a lesson: after that episode I have never cheated
                again, not once.
                Being honest has become an essential part of my being, along with kindness and respect: by growing up I
                realized that honesty cannot exist without them :<em>“kindness without honesty is just lying, and
                    honesty
                    without kindness is just rudeness”</em>(from the web).<br>
                I grew up in a family where honesty, trust and respect were the foundations of every relationship,
                foundations that had to be earned not given away. My parents have always encouraged me to speak openly,
                to
                confide in them and not hide anything, they have always given way to the words more than punishments.

            <h1>strengths and limitations</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I took the Myers-Briggs personality test and got ISFJ-A -” The Defender”:</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>”The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of
                    their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent analytical abilities; though
                    reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they
                    are generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so
                    many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it
                    is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are.”</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>From the test  result I surely identify myself with the following strengths:
                <br>
                    <strong>Reliable and Patient</strong> – Rather than offering sporadic, excited rushes that leave things half finished, Defenders are meticulous and careful, taking a steady approach and bending with the needs of the situation just enough to accomplish their end goals. Defenders not only ensure that things are done to the highest standard, but often go well beyond what is required.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Enthusiastic</strong> – When the goal is right, Defenders take all this support, reliability and imagination and apply it to something they believe will make a difference in people’s lives – whether fighting poverty with a global initiative or simply making a customer’s day.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Loyal and Hard-Working</strong> – Given a little time, this enthusiasm grows into loyalty – Defender personalities often form an emotional attachment to the ideas and organizations they’ve dedicated themselves to. Anything short of meeting their obligations with good, hard work fails their own expectations.
