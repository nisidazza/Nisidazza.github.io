        <h1>Personal Core Values</h1>
        <div class="first-row">
            <div class="first-col">
                <p>"Core values are the fundamental beliefs of a person or organization. These guiding principles
                    dictate
                    behavior and can help people understand the difference between right and wrong."</p>
                <br>
                <p>Based on the above definition I can assert that my personal core values are Honesty, Kindness and
                    Respect.
                    I am an honest person―the truth always matters to me more than anything else.
                    If I value this quality so much is because when I was in Middle School I was the one who did not
                    behave correctly: “Let him who is without sin cast the first stone”, right?
                    Here’s what happened: I cheated during a Music test. I hadn't studied as well as I should have so I
                    kept my book opened with all my notes under my desk and I shamelessly copied all the answers. Well,
                    obviously I got caught by my teacher. I was not so smart as I thought, after all. He took both my
                    test and my book without any admonition, I felt so ashamed of myself.
                    And so what? You would say.
                    The following day ,during an after school activity - choir practice - my Music teacher had the
                    brilliant idea to return the book to me and tell everybody what I did. It was so humiliating and for
                    a person like me, shy and insecure, it was a pretty bad beating.
