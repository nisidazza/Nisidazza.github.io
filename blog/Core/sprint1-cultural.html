            <h1>Personal Core Values</h1>
            <br>
            <h5><em>"Core values are the fundamental beliefs of a person or organization. These guiding principles
                    dictate
                    behavior and can help people understand the difference between right and wrong."</em></h5>
            <br>
            <p>Based on the above definition I can assert that my personal core values are <em>Honesty, Kindness
                    and Respect</em>.<br>
                The truth always matters to me more than anything else.
                If I value this quality so much is because when I was in Middle School I was the one who did not
                behave correctly: “Let him who is without sin cast the first stone”, right?
                Here’s what happened: I cheated during a Music test. I hadn't studied as well as I should have
                so I
                kept my book opened with all my notes under my desk and I shamelessly copied all the answers.
                Well,
                obviously I got caught by my teacher. I was not so smart as I thought, after all. He took both
                my
                test and my book without any admonition, I felt so ashamed of myself.
                And so what? You would say.
                The following day ,during an after school activity - choir practice - my Music teacher had the
                brilliant idea to return the book to me and tell everybody what I did. It was so humiliating and
                for
                a child like me, shy and insecure, it was a pretty bad beating.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5><em>“Your values create your internal compass that can navigate how you make decisions in your life. If
                    you
                    compromise your core values, you go nowhere.” ― Roy T. Bennett
                </em></h5>
            <br>
            <p>Maybe this could seem a ridiculous example but I learnt a lesson: after that episode I have never cheated
                again, not once.
                Being honest has become an essential part of my being, along with kindness and respect: by growing up I
                realized that honesty cannot exist without them :<em>“kindness without honesty is just lying, and
                    honesty
                    without kindness is just rudeness”</em> (from the web).<br>
                I grew up in a family where honesty, trust and respect were the foundations of every relationship,
                foundations that had to be earned not given away. My parents have always encouraged me to speak openly,
                to confide in them and not hide anything. Of course listening to them was also part of the deal: I have
                learnt to let finishing other people's sentences , be open to other suggestions, embrace others’ ideas
                without judging from the start.

            <h1>strengths and limitations</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I took the Myers-Briggs personality test and got ISFJ-A -” The Defender”:</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>”The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of
                    their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent analytical abilities; though
                    reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they
                    are generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so
                    many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it
                    is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are.”</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>From the test result I identified the following strengths :
                <br>
                <strong>Reliable and Patient</strong> – Rather than offering sporadic, excited rushes that leave things
                half finished, Defenders are meticulous and careful, taking a steady approach and bending with the needs
                of the situation just enough to accomplish their end goals. Defenders not only ensure that things are
                done to the highest standard, but often go well beyond what is required.
                <br>
                <strong>Enthusiastic</strong> – When the goal is right, Defenders take all this support, reliability and
                imagination and apply it to something they believe will make a difference in people’s lives – whether
                fighting poverty with a global initiative or simply making a customer’s day.
                <br>
                <strong>Loyal and Hard-Working</strong> – Given a little time, this enthusiasm grows into loyalty –
                Defender personalities often form an emotional attachment to the ideas and organizations they’ve
                dedicated themselves to. Anything short of meeting their obligations with good, hard work fails their
                own expectations.
            </p>
            <p>The test has also defined some of the weaknesses I identify with:
                <br>
                <strong>Humble and Shy</strong> – The meek shall inherit the earth, but it’s a long road if they receive
                no recognition at all. This is possibly Defenders’ biggest challenge, as they are so concerned with
                others’ feelings that they refuse to make their thoughts known, or to take any duly earned credit for
                their contributions. Defenders’ standards for themselves are also so high that, knowing they could have
                done some minor aspect of a task better, they often downplay their successes entirely.
                <br>
                <strong>Take Things Too Personally</strong> –Defenders have trouble separating personal and impersonal
                situations – any situation is still an interaction between two people, after all – and any negativity
                from conflict or criticism can carry over from their professional to their personal lives, and back
                again.
                <br>
                <strong>Overload Themselves</strong> – Their strong senses of duty and perfectionism combine with this
                aversion to emotional conflict to create a situation where it is far too easy for Defenders to overload
                themselves – or to be overloaded by others – as they struggle silently to meet everyone’s expectations,
                especially their own.
            </p>

            <p>During my first work experience I was working as a back-office employee for a company who provided
                insurance packages on behalf of a Bank to its clients. The final step before sending those packages
                away, consisted in printing the Welcome Letter for each customer and put both the letter and the
                assurance package in an envelope. The heading of each letter was selected based on the type of package
                chosen. My mistake was to print all the letters (something like over 200) with the same heading. I was
                so mortified for that ridiculous mistake that I soon as I noticed it, I immediately reported the issue
                to one of my superiors and I offered to skip my lunch in order to print the right letters. Armed with a
                lot of patience I spent that afternoon inputting all those letters in their respective envelope so they
                could be collected for shipping the same evening. From that experience I have learnt to keep more attention
                on what I am doing and check every detail; <em>taking responsibility for my actions</em> has become one
                of my biggest strengths.
            </p>
            <p>Since I was a child I always had a good role models to follow. Both my parents and all my teachers from
                preschool since high school have taught me to be kind, helpful and try to do my best in every situation.
                I consider <em>consistency and hard-working</em> two of the most important strengths both in my
                educational and
                career paths: I always make great effort to reach and deliver constant and reliable
                results.<br><em>Remaining
                    humble and grounded</em> also help me dealing with every challenge: I don’t let accomplishments or
                rewards go
                to my head or affect my attitude; I am always polite to my colleagues or fellow student, my superiors or
                friends. One of the motto I have always tried to follow is <em>“treat others how you want to be
                    treated”</em>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Obviously, every coin has two sides and my strengths have accompanied me during my life along with my
                weaknesses.</p>
