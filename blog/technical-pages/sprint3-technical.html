            <h1>HTML vs CSS</h1>
            <p>
                An analogy to explain the differences between HTML and CSS could be a painting.<br>The HTML is
                represented
                by the canvas where you draw the elements you are going to paint. The drawing provides guidelines for
                the painter to follow.<br> CSS is the set of colors and tools the
                painter is going to use to bring his sketch alive: acrylics or oils paints, colors needed, type of
                brushes to achive a particular effects and so on.

            <h1>Control Flow & Loops: everyday life examples</h1>
            <p>The <strong>control flow</strong> is the order in which the computer executes statements in a
                script.<br>Usually when code runs, it starts from the first line to the last one, but if the computer
                bumps into some program structure, like conditionals and loops, the order of execution changes.
            </p>
            <img src="technical-images/monkey-umbrella.gif" alt="Monkey with umbrella" class="animated-gif-monkey">
            <p>A <u>conditional statement</u> allows you to carry out an action based on a condition.<br>
                <strong>If statement</strong> : the code is executed if a condition is true.<br>
                <em>If it’s raining, take your umbrella!</em><br>
                <strong>If...else statement</strong> : else statement is executed if the condition is false.<br>
                <em>If the light in the control panel of the oven turn off, put the food into the oven, otherwise
                    wait.</em><br>
                <strong>If..else if..else statement</strong> : this statement specifies a new condition if the first
                condition is false.<br>
                <em>If your body temperature is > 40°C go to the hospital, else if it's > 37°C take
                    some medicine, else take some rest.</em>
            </p>
            <img src="technical-images/pouring-water.gif" alt="Pouring water" class="animated-gif-water">
            <p>A <u>loop</u> allows you to repeat an action a certain number of times. Different kinds of loop
                mechanisms enable you to define the start and the end of a loop.<br>
                <strong>For statement</strong> : the loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.<br>
                <em>Go through each item on a grocery list until all the items have been stricken off and there is
                    nothing more left.</em><br>
                <strong>Do...while statement</strong> : is always executed once before the condition is checked and the
                loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.<br>
                <em>Keep your glasses on, while you are reading a book.</em><br>
                <strong>While statement</strong> : executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to
                true.<br>
                <em>While the glass is empty, pur water.</em>

        <div class="dom">
            <h1>The DOM: what is it and how interact with it?</h1>
            <img src="technical-images/dom-tree.jpeg" alt="DOM Tree" class="dom-tree">
            <p>The DOM stands for <strong>“Document Object Model”</strong> and it’s created from the Browser when a page
                is loaded.<br>
                It’s separated into 3 different parts: Core DOM, XML DOM, HTML DOM.<br>
                The <strong>HTML DOM</strong> is an object representation, an interface to an HTML document.<br>
                It is structured as a <em>tree of Objects</em> and each element in the DOM is called “node”. Example of
                nodes are
                elements, attributes, text content, comments, document-related stuff and other things; this list does
                not include pseudo-elements (e.g. ::after) and hidden elements (e.g. with display: none).
            </p>
            <h5>Interacting with the DOM</h5>
            <p>The DOM allows JavaScript to access the text content and elements of the website document as
                objects
                by using properties and methods.<br>
                When you're interested in a particular DOM node, <em>Inspect</em> is an easy and fast way to open
                DevTools and
                investigate that node.</p>
            <img src="technical-images/JS_editing_DOM.JPG" alt="DOM Interface" class="dom-interface">
            <p>The below images show how the DOM can be modified by client-side Javascript:
                <ol>
                    <li>We start by typing <em>document.body</em> into the console:</li><br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="technical-images/JS_editing_DOM2.JPG" alt="Console - document.body" class="dom-console">
                    <li>We can type <em>document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'color'; </em> to change the background
                        color of the body object:</li>
                    <img src="technical-images/JS_editing_DOM3.JPG" alt="DevTools-Console - set background color"
                        class="dom-console">
                    <li>If we type in the console <em>document.body</em> or we go to the Elements tab, we can see that
                        the
                        DOM has changed:</li>
                    <img src="technical-images/JS_editing_DOM4.JPG" alt="Changed DOM" class="dom-console">
                    <li>But if we right-click on the page and we select “View Page Source”, we can see that the source
                        of the website does not contain the new background color added via Javascript.
                    </li>
                    <img src="technical-images/JS_editing_DOM-view-page-source.JPG" alt="View Page Source"
                        class="view-page-source">
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>You can also edit, hide or move the nodes by doing double-click on the content you want to change, or
                drag it if you want to move it, and see how those changes affect the page.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="array-object">
            <h1>Accessing data from arrays and objects: what's the difference?</h1>
            <h5>Arrays</h5>
            <p>Each item in an array is identified by a number called its <u>index</u>.<br>
                <em>let myFlowersArray = [“orchid”, ”rose”, ”lily”];</em><br>
                Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array is element 0.<br>
                <em>orchid: index 0; rose: index 1; lily: index 2;</em><br>
                You can access a particular element by passing its index to the array name within square brackets.<br>
                <em>myFlowersArray[0]; // orchid</em><br>
                <em>myFlowersArray[1]; // rose</em><br>
                <em>myFlowersArray[2]; // lily</em><br>
            </p>
            <h5>Objects</h5>
            <p>An object is created by using figure brackets {} with a list of properties.<br>
                <em>let movie = { "name": “Pride & Prejudice”, "year-released": 2005, "director": “Joe Wright”
                    }</em><br>
                You can access a particular property by using dot notation or square brackets.<br>
                <em>console.log(movie.name); → output: Pride & Prejudice</em><br>
                <em>console.log(movie.[‘director’]); → output: Joe Wright</em>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="functions">
            <h1>Functions: why they are useful</h1>
            <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that groups together a set of statements to perform a specific
                task. A code inside functions is run whenever that function is called. (see example below).</p>
                <img src="technical-images/function-example.JPG" alt="example of js function"><br>
                <p>They are useful when you have a few lines of code that needs to be used several times.<br>
                Also, in Javascript, a function is an object, that means that we can assign it to variables,
                to array elements and to other objects;  we can pass it as parameter into another
                function, or it can be returned from another function (see example below).</p>
