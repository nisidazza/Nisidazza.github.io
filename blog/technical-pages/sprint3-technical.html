            <h1>HTML vs CSS</h1>
            <p>
                An analogy to explain the differences between HTML and CSS could be a painting.<br>The HTML is
                represented
                by the canvas where you draw the elements you are going to paint. The drawing provides guidelines for
                the painter to follow.<br> CSS is the set of colors and tools the
                painter is going to use to bring his sketch alive: acrylics or oils paints, colors needed, type of
                brushes to achive a particular effects and so on.

            <h1>Control Flow & Loops: everyday life examples</h1>
            <p>The <strong>control flow</strong> is the order in which the computer executes statements in a
                script.<br>Usually when code runs, it starts from the first line to the last one, but if the computer
                bumps into some program structure, like conditionals and loops, the order of execution changes.

            <p>A <u>conditional statement</u> allows you to carry out an action based on a condition.<br>
                <strong>If statement</strong> : the code is executed if a condition is true.<br>
                <em>If it’s raining, take your umbrella!</em><br>
                <strong>If...else statement</strong> : else statement is executed if the condition is false.<br>
                <em>If the light in the control panel of the oven turn off, put the food into the oven, otherwise
                    wait.</em><br>
                <strong>If..else if..else statement</strong> : this statement specifies a new condition if the first
                condition is false.<br>
                <em>If your body temperature is > 40°C go to the hospital, else if it's > 37°C take
                    some medicine, else take some rest.</em>
            </p>

            <img src="technical-images/pouring-water.gif" alt="Pouring water" class="animated-gif-water">
            <p>A <u>loop</u> allows you to repeat an action a certain number of times. Different kinds of loop mechanisms enable you to define the start and the end of a loop.<br>
                    <strong>For statement</strong> : the loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.<br> 
                    <em>Go through each item on a grocery list until all the items have been stricken off and there is nothing more left.</em><br>
                    <strong>Do...while statement</strong> : is always executed once before the condition is checked and the loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.<br>
                    <em>Keep your glasses on, while you are reading a book.</em><br>
                    <strong>While statement</strong> : executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.<br>
                    <em>While the glass is empty, pur water.</em>
