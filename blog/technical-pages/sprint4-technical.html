        <h1>I tell you a story about a time...</h1><br>
        <h3>I got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <img src="technical-images/stuck_on_problem.jpg" alt="A Monkey thinking" class="stuck-on-problem">
        <p>I was
            following a tutorial to learn Javascript, a programming language commonly used when you want to make a
            webpage dynamic and add special effects on pages. I was trying to solve one of the challenges: the task
            consisted in
            using a <em>for loop</em> (it allows code to be executed repeatedly) to add the value of each element of an
            array ( a
            collection/group of elements) to a variable <em>total</em> that at the beginning was set to zero. The
            problem
            was
            pretty simple to solve and I was sure about my solution, but the test failed to pass.<br>I re-checked the
            logic
            of my code, went through each line by repeating to myself, in simple words, what each step should have done,
            and
            it
            seemed all good to me. I did not know what to change or what to do so, I googled for a solution to my
            problem
            and my code turned out to be correct but the test still did not pass.<br> I felt really
            frustrated and hopeless. So I read the assignment again and then my code carefully, when I noticed... a typo
            error!!! I wrote down “lenght” instead
            of “length”. Now, every time that a test does not pass, the first thing I do is checking the spelling!
        </p><br>
        <h3>I solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
        <img src="technical-images/businesswoman-boxing-.jpg" alt="Business Woman Boxing" class="solve-problem">
        <p>In the Built-in Methods Kata there was a problem in which we needed to map over every word in a given
            sentence and capitalize the first letter of every word.<br> We needed to create a function - a piece of code
            that perform a task and return an output - that took, for example, the sentence “i love styling a website”
            and returned "I Love Styling A Website". I decided to use a problem solving technique called
            <em>pseudocode</em> :
            basically you have to describe in plain english what your piece of code should do.<br> So I started writing
            in simple words, line by line, what my function should have done, and searching for the relative methods
            that
            would allow me to do it. Looking for
            some examples on Google, also helped me to understand how to apply the different methods to my code. At the
            end I put all the pieces together and wrote my function.<br> I felt really confident throughout the process
            by using this problem-solving technique, all was clear and neat. I think this approach is very useful for
            putting ideas in order and understand what to do, instead of going to trials and errors.
        </p><br>
        <h3>How confident I feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode - </strong> I have started using it while I was learning Javascript and I have found
                it really useful. I will
                try to keep working with it during my coding process.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Trying something - </strong> I always do that after pseudocoding and googling.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rubber ducky method - </strong> I should practice this method more. Sometimes I repeat something
                to myself but more mentally than out loud.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reading error messages - </strong> I usually read error messages but at times I don’t
                understand what they mean so I have to google them.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Console.logging - </strong> I use it very often to actually see what my code is doing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Googling - </strong> Good thing they invented it! I use Google every time I need to look for
                something. I have also some websites I refer to when I need some help such as CodeAcademy, W3Schools,
                Stack Overflow.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Asking your peers for help - </strong> Once I know them well, I have no problem asking for help.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Asking coaches for help - </strong> This is my last resort, I want to be sure I have run out of
                all the others.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection - </strong> Now that I started learning Javascript I have
                often found myself thinking about it while I have been doing something else, for example I reflect on
                how to resolve a problem while I am making dinner. I am trying to make it a habit, to strengthen new
                knowledge.
