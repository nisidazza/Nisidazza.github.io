                <p></p>
                <h5>Rules of the Game</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>The minesweeper board is a square of different sizes.</li>
                    <li>The board has a predetermined number of randomly placed mines. The player cannot see them.</li>
                    <li>Cells can exist in one of two states: opened or closed. Clicking on a cell opens it. If a mine
                        was lurking there, the game ends in failure. If there is no mine in the cell, but there are
                        mines in one or more of its neighboring cells, then the opened cell shows the neighboring mine
                        count. When none of the cellâ€™s neighbors are mined, each one of those cells is opened
                        automatically.</li>
                    <li>Right clicking on a cell marks it with a flag. The flag indicates that the player knows there is
                        a mine lurking there.</li>
                    <li>The player wins the game if he/she opens all cells without mines.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>You will find the "look" of my minesweeper different from the original, but the rules are always the same. Have fun!</p>
